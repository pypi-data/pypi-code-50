            pretrained weights or the path to the weights file to be loaded.
        weight_quantization (int): sets all weights in the model to have
            a particular quantization bitwidth except for the weights in the
            first layer.

            * '0' implements floating point 32-bit weights.
            * '2' through '8' implements n-bit weights where n is from 2-8 bits.
        activ_quantization: sets all activations in the model to have a
            particular activation quantization bitwidth.

            * '0' implements floating point 32-bit activations.
            * '1' through '8' implements n-bit weights where n is from 1-8 bits.
        input_weight_quantization: sets weight quantization in the first layer.
            Defaults to weight_quantization value.

            * 'None' implements the same bitwidth as the other weights.
            * '0' implements floating point 32-bit weights.
